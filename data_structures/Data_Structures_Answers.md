Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) - Stack grows according to amount of nodes

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
   O(n)  the amount of memory needed increases with each node prportionately
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) The queue grows based on the amount of nodes
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
  O(n) memory usage is based on the amount of nodes present 
5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
   O(n log n) in a worst case scenario.
6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array? O(1)
